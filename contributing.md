// TODO. NEED TO ADD CONTENTS FROM README REFACTOR

* When it’s appropriate to follow up (ex. “You can expect a response from a maintainer within 7 days. If you haven’t heard anything by then, feel free to ping the thread.”)


* Triage backlog http://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-gardener
* If you don’t want to accept a contribution:
  * Thank them for their contribution
  * Explain why it doesn’t fit into the scope of the project, and offer clear suggestions for improvement, if you’re able. Be kind, but firm.
  * Link to relevant documentation, if you have it. If you notice repeated requests for things you don’t want to accept, add them into your documentation to avoid repeating yourself.
  * Close the request

Great example:
* https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
contributing

* Organize issues
* Create detailed documentation for set-up.
